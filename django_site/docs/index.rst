django_site documentation
=========================

django_site is a small scale project based on my will to open a plush store.
In developping journey, I am trying and testing a lot of frameworks.

This project's objective is to display a small website that will allow
the user to check a catlog of products and current orders, called commissions.
The user is able to create and add new commissions to the database.

The project is under the GNU 3.O public licence.
